# Project 4

**Project task**


To implement a simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.

started by running `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt upgrade`

Got a prompt requesting kernel upgrade:

restarted the Ubuntu server from the terminal so that the kernel upgrade will complete

changed to windows terminal afterwards and added required certificates which also confirmed kernel was upgraded

Then, installed node.js

`sudo apt install -y nodejs`
